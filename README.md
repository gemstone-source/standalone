# Vulneraribility-Scanner
As the use of computer systems and software applications continues to grow, so does the importance of ensuring their security. The vulnerabilities that exist in these applications can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive data or cause damage to the system. This highlights the need for vulnerability scanners, which are tools designed to identify and assess security vulnerabilities present in various software applications.

The aim of this final year project is to develop a standalone vulnerability scanner that can identify security vulnerabilities in installed Windows applications. The scanner will utilize the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database, which is a comprehensive catalog of known security vulnerabilities and exposures.

The scanner will work by scanning the system for installed Windows applications and then checking them against the CVE database to identify any known vulnerabilities. It will then provide a report to the user on the vulnerabilities found, their severity, and recommended actions to mitigate them.

The project will utilize the C programming language to develop the scanner, and the CVE database will be integrated into the scanner to allow for easy access and analysis of vulnerability data. The scanner will be designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and accurate in identifying vulnerabilities.

The importance of this project cannot be overstated, as it will provide a valuable tool to help individuals and organizations secure their computer systems and applications against potential attacks. It will also provide a platform for further research and development in the field of vulnerability scanning, as well as contribute to the overall improvement of cybersecurity.
